# Recursive Huffman Coding Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm, a widely used technique for lossless data compression. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters, and longer codes assigned to less frequent characters. This allows for efficient compression of data by representing common characters with fewer bits. This implementation utilizes a recursive approach to construct the Huffman tree.
