# Recursive Huffman Coding Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the Huffman coding algorithm, a widely used technique for lossless data compression. Huffman coding assigns variable-length codes to input characters, with shorter codes assigned to more frequent characters and longer codes assigned to less frequent characters. This allows for efficient compression of data by representing common characters with fewer bits. This implementation utilizes a recursive approach to construct the Huffman tree, making it both a concise and effective method of data compression.

## Usage
To use this Huffman coding implementation, ensure you have Java installed on your machine. You can then compile and run the program using a Java development environment or directly from the command line. You could also run the code on a IDE like visual studio code. When ran, enter a string when prompted and then press enter. Then the algorithm will run and you can view the output in the console. 

### Compilation
To compile the program, navigate to the directory containing the `HuffmanCoding.java` file and run the following command:

```bash
javac HuffmanCoding.java
